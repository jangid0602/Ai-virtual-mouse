Project Summary---------------------------
The AI Virtual Mouse project leverages computer vision and machine learning techniques to develop a virtual mouse controlled by hand gestures. This technology allows users to interact with their computer without a physical mouse, enhancing accessibility and providing an innovative way to control devices. The project aims to offer a seamless and intuitive user experience by accurately interpreting hand movements and gestures.
Problem Statement:
Traditional mice can be inconvenient or unusable for some users due to physical limitations or specific use cases. The AI Virtual Mouse project addresses this challenge by offering a hands-free solution that relies on hand gestures, providing greater accessibility and convenience.

Objective:-----------------------------
The objective of the AI Virtual Mouse project is to create a reliable and user-friendly virtual mouse that interprets hand gestures using computer vision and machine learning, thereby enhancing accessibility and user experience.

Features:--------------------------------
Functional features of the project include:
Hand gesture recognition for mouse movement and clicks
Customizable gestures for different mouse actions
Real-time hand tracking and gesture interpretation
Integration with various operating systems and applications
Can be used in AR/VR games
Technical Requirements:
The project requires computer vision and machine learning algorithms to recognize and interpret hand gestures. Python, along with libraries such as OpenCV for computer vision and TensorFlow or PyTorch for machine learning, is used for developing the recognition models. Additionally, a user interface is developed using frameworks like Tkinter or PyQt to allow users to calibrate and customize their virtual mouse settings.
Libraries used:
Autopy
Numpy
Mediapipe
Opencv
Handtracking module
