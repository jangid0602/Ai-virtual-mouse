Project Summary:
The AI Virtual Mouse project leverages computer vision and machine learning techniques to develop a virtual mouse controlled by hand gestures. This technology allows users to interact with their computer without a physical mouse, enhancing accessibility and providing an innovative way to control devices. The project aims to offer a seamless and intuitive user experience by accurately interpreting hand movements and gestures.
Introduction:
The AI Virtual Mouse project uses advanced computer vision and machine learning algorithms to recognize and interpret hand gestures, enabling users to control their computers without a traditional mouse. This technology provides a novel interaction method, particularly beneficial for users with physical disabilities or those seeking more natural ways to interact with their devices.
Problem Statement:
Traditional mice can be inconvenient or unusable for some users due to physical limitations or specific use cases. The AI Virtual Mouse project addresses this challenge by offering a hands-free solution that relies on hand gestures, providing greater accessibility and convenience.
Objective:
The objective of the AI Virtual Mouse project is to create a reliable and user-friendly virtual mouse that interprets hand gestures using computer vision and machine learning, thereby enhancing accessibility and user experience.
Scope / Target Audience:
The project targets individual users seeking alternative interaction methods with their computers, as well as organizations looking to provide accessible technology solutions. The audience includes users with physical disabilities, technology enthusiasts, and developers interested in innovative human-computer interaction techniques.
Features:
Functional features of the project include:
Hand gesture recognition for mouse movement and clicks
Customizable gestures for different mouse actions
Real-time hand tracking and gesture interpretation
Integration with various operating systems and applications
Calibration options to adjust sensitivity and responsiveness
Technical Requirements:
The project requires computer vision and machine learning algorithms to recognize and interpret hand gestures. Python, along with libraries such as OpenCV for computer vision and TensorFlow or PyTorch for machine learning, is used for developing the recognition models. Additionally, a user interface is developed using frameworks like Tkinter or PyQt to allow users to calibrate and customize their virtual mouse settings.
